Closed date : 2018-10-16 09:11:26.447 Case Resolved Dear Constituent      The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector has identified that vault on the sidewalk needing attention as the responsibility of Ever source Electric.      Replacing or repairing vaults is not an easy repair.       Ever source has to have the vaults custom made for each separate location.       This takes time.  In addition the construction itself is technical and involved  as well as expensive.      We have informed Ever source Electric that they have to set aside resources to repair vaults around the City.     The estimated time for replacement is 6-9 months.       However  we will require Ever source to make a temporary repair such as the use of asphalt  especially if it is a major tripping hazard.      The temporary repair should be done within 3 business days.      For any questions or concern  please contact the number listed below     Sincerely      Mark Cardarelli  Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance  Boston Public Works Department  617-635-4951 Office   ,Sidewalk Repair,Public Works Department,Highway Maintenance,Sidewalk Repair,PWDx_Contractor Complaints,PWDx,NULL,NULL,INTERSECTION of Fairfield St & Commonwealth Ave  Boston  MA  ,4,1C,7,D4,Back Bay,14,5,508,,INTERSECTION Fairfield St & Commonwealth Ave,,Intersection,15346,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"
